             Foreword

The Colorado Department of Transportation’s Cost Estimating Services Unit
of the Construction Engineering Services Branch publishes the Cost Data
Book annually. A joint effort has been made between the Department’s
sections and the Cost Estimating Services Unit to gather and record cost
data for this publication.

The following data includes weighted average prices for items on highway
construction projects that were bid during the 2023 calendar year. Caution
should be used in applying these historical averages to specific projects.
Allowances for varying geographic, climatic, social, economic conditions
and type of project should be made.

Changes and improvements are continually being made to update and
increase the usefulness for future issues. Comments and suggestions for
improvements for users of this publication are welcome.
